Hi there, I'm <a href="https://shubheksha.com/"> Shubheksha</a>! I currently work as a software engineer at Microsoft. I like computers...a lot. I enjoy learning about systems in my free time, I find distributed systems in particular very fascinating. So I decided to dig deeper on my own, which is the reason I started this blog - to consume the vast amount of existing literature already out there. I enjoy reading academic papers and summarizing them to help make the content more digestable. Apart from computers, I really enjoy reading and writing.

If you have any questions or just want to chat, you can reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ScribblingOn"> Twitter </a> or shoot me an
