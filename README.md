This site is built using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) & deployed using [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
It uses the [Manis](https://github.com/yursan9/manis-hugo-theme/) theme. I'm using a slightly tweaked version of the
theme located [here](https://github.com/shubheksha/manis-hugo-theme/).


You need to have Hugo [installed](http://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) to build & run this site locally.

To build the site, run:
`hugo`

To build the site, launch it locally with live reloading:
`hugo server`
